1. Inferential Statistics:
	
	  a. Descriptive statistics
	
	  b. Exploratory statistics
	
    c. Predictive statistics
	
	  - [x]    	  d. Both a and b

2. Types of Data:

     - [x]      a. Quantitative

   b. Discrete

   c. Nominal

   d. All of the above

  

3. What does the p-value in hypothesis testing represent?

   a. Probability of the null hypothesis being true

   b. Probability of the alternative hypothesis being true

     - [x]      c. Probability of obtaining the observed results or more extreme, assuming the null hypothesis is true

   d. Probability of a Type II error

  

4. If you increase the confidence level from 90% to 95% in a confidence interval, what happens to the width of the interval?

	 a. It stays the same
	
	b. It becomes narrower
	
    - [x]    		c. It becomes wider
	
	 d. It depends on the sample size

  

5. What is the main goal of inferential statistics?

	a. Describe and summarize data
	
    - [x]    	b. Make predictions about a population based on a sample
	
	c. Identify patterns in a dataset
	
	d. Calculate measures of central tendency

  

6. Which of the following is an example of inferential statistics?

	a. Calculating the mean of a sample
	
	b. Describing the frequency distribution of a dataset
	
    - [x]    	c. Making predictions about a population based on a sample
	
	d. Organizing data into a bar chart

  

7. If you categorize data as "low," "medium," and "high," what type of data are you dealing with?

	a. Nominal
	
    - [x]    	b. Ordinal
	
	c. Interval
	
	d. Ratio

  

8. The null hypothesis is typically a statement of:

    - [x]    	a. No effect or no difference
	
	b. An expected outcome
	
	c. A significant result
	
	d. The mean of the population

  

9. A wider confidence interval indicates:

	a. Higher precision
	
    - [x]    	b. Lower precision
	
    - [x]    	c. Higher confidence
	
	d. Lower confidence

  

10. Which of the following is an example of ordinal data?

	b. Temperature
	
    - [x]    		c. Likert scale responses
	
	d. Weight
